read the link, the workflow are similiar to it.

at least 2 grpc servers:

one is client , one is server.

thrift is not advanced than grpc.

requests all from rocksdb node, client talk to grpc server, make request of update.

only have two choices, pull or push.

it is a hybrid model.

GetLatestSequenceNumber().

python read and write.

rocksdb is the file system, two grpc server listen read or pull.

one slave is fine.

no fault tolerance.

for loop at least on server side. for loop running grpc

50% on grpc, how to handle connection. only sync is fine. async is not necessary.

need to use decorator on the assignment.
